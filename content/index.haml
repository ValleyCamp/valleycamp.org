  %p Nestled at the foot of Snoqualmie Pass about seven miles East of North Bend, Washington, Valley Camp is within an hourâ€™s drive of Seattle. Our 52 acre area is surrounded by forest and offers the peacefulness of the outdoors, in the beauty of the meadows, mountains, trees and streams, with deer and elk often grazing nearby.
  %p Our facilities include a retreat center, picnic shelter, cabin, RV hookups, and plenty of room for camping. With outdoor areas including play structures, fire gazebos, and miles of hiking trails we offer a great location to come visit for an afternoon or a multi-day adventure.
  %p While we are a Lutheran organization, during times the camp is not being used by Lutheran sponsored groups, we will take reservations from other non-profit religious, educational, cultural, and public-service groups who have interests that are compatible with our mission and Christian principles.
