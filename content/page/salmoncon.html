<h1 style="text-align: center;">Salmoncon IX, 11-14 July, 2014<br /><span style="font-size: 12px;">Schedule of Events</span></h1>
<p style="text-align: center;">By Wayne, NB6M<br />May 9, 2014</p>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Location/Contact</span></h3>
<p>Valley Camp, 49515 SE Middle Fork Road, North Bend, WA 98045&nbsp;</p>
<p>425-888-1852 (info@valleycamp.org) valleycamp.org&nbsp;</p>
<p>The center of the RV Campground is located at: 47.4650 N / 121.6797 W</p>
<p>440 Simplex on 446.525 MHz, NO TONE&nbsp;</p>
<p>Node # 98045 for Echolink IRLP Node # 7808&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Campsite reservations should be made early, by each individual, for RVs.</li>
<li>There is plenty of tent space, over a wide area (good separation of antennas).&nbsp;</li>
<li>Presentations will occur in the Cedar Grove group shelter.&nbsp;</li>
<li>A computer projector and screen and a sound system are available.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Portable Stations will be set up in the group shelter and in other locations.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Special Event Callsign K7S has been reserved for Salmoncon once again.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Suggested Items to bring for Radio Activities</span></h3>
<p>Given the fact that there is a tower and beam with rotator available for us, as well as tall trees with pulleys already installed, both near the group shelter and the RV camp ground, we will have the opportunity to get several portable stations on the air. There is a Triplexer also, which means that the beam can be used on 20, 15 and 10 at the same time.</p>
<p>Do bring either complete portable stations, antennas, favorite paddles, or any other radio related items that would help provide the variety of rigs, stations, and station equipment that we all enjoy seeing and trying out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is discussion of the possibility of activating a SOTA station from a nearby peak. Stay tuned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>TAKE NOTE: PNW QRP does not charge a fee for attending Salmoncon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, because of the fact that Valley Camp does not charge us a fee for the use of the group shelter, including kitchen facilities, sound system, beam antenna, and so forth, we ask each attendee to make an appropriate donation directly to Valley Camp. A collection box will be available in the presentation area of the Group Shelter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Items For the Group to Contribute Towards Meals</span></h3>
<p>Although PNW QRP members are providing most of the foodstuffs for meals during Salmoncon, there are a few items attendees can help with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Early attendees should bring side dishes and trimmings for Friday evening's Brats and Polish Sausage BBQ.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Attendees bring side dishes and/or desserts to accompany Saturday evening's traditional Salmonburger meal.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Attendees bring side dishes and/or desserts to accompany Sunday evening's steak BBQ</li>
