%div.fac_description
  %p The Cedar Grove Picnic shelter is one of the historic structures here at Valley Camp. It was renovated in the spring of 2007, updating the lighting and kitchen area.
  %p The shelter has a 4 burner stove top, microwave, refrigerator, a prep sink and double wash sinks with hot and cold running water. At the rear of the shelter is a Barbecue holding up to 20lb of charcoal and a dutch oven platform, providing you plenty of space to make food with that realistic "made in the woods" taste.
  %p This facility is great for family reunions, wedding receptions, church picnics, outdoor classroom space for a school or science center, and RV group gatherings. This is the facility that the Amateur Radio community uses for the radio events and emergency services events.
