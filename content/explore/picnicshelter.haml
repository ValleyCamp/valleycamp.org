%div.fac_description
  %p The Cedar Grove Picnic shelter is one of the historic structures here at Valley Camp. It was renovated in the spring of 2007, updating the lighting and kitchen area.
  %p The shelter now has a 4 burner stove top, microwave, refrigerator, a prep sink and double wash sinks with hot and cold running water. At the rear of the shelter is a Barbecue holding up to 20lb of charcoal and a dutch oven platform, providing you plenty of space to make food with that realistic "made in the woods" taste.
  %p This facility is great for family reunions, wedding receptions, church picnics, and RV group gatherings. This is the facility that the Amateur Radio community uses for the radio events and emergency services events.
