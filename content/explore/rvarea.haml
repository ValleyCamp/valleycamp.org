%div.fac_description
  %p The Upper Meadow Campground is designed for RVâ€™s, although when sites are available these can be used for tenters. Nearby there is space for group tenting. RV sites are spacious and surrounded by grass lawn and each has views of the surrounding mountains. The RV sites are close to the Cedar Grove Picnic Shelter, the covered Community Fire Gazebo, and our safe family friendly playground.
  %p The RV sites have power (30 amp service), water, sewer and free WiFi.
