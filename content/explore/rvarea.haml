%div.fac_description
  %p The Upper Meadow Campground is designed for RVâ€™s, although when sites are available these can be used for tenters. Nearby there is space for group tenting. RV sites are spacious and surrounded by grass lawn and each has views of the surrounding mountains. The RV sites are close to the Cedar Grove Picnic Shelter, the covered Community Fire Gazebo, and our safe family friendly playground.
  %p The RV sites have power (30 amp service), water, sewer and free WiFi. (Note: Due to our service provider, our wifi isn't particularly fast. You may be able to stream video online, but if everyone in camp starts doing the same it can get quite slow.)
  %p Perfect for a gathering of friends, Grandparent weekend, a good game of bocce ball, or deer & elk watching, the RV area is a great place for camping with a group, or meeting some new friends! Our RV sites are open and accesible, yet large enough that you won't feel like you're peering in your neighbors window unless you want to.

  %div.subhead Notes
  For the safety and sanity of everyone the speed limit inside the camp is <b>5 MPH</b>. Please take your time and enjoy the view when driving through camp.
  %br
  For their own safety all pets must be leashed and under control at all times. We do have wild animals at camp, so please do not leave pets unattended even if tied up. Any excessive barking, meowing, or mooing will be may invite a shushing from fellow campers or camp staff, please be considerate.
