%div.fac_description
  %p Looking for a place for a quiet time away? This is it, with meadow and mountain views, and cozy porches; think of it as your own private fully furnished mountain retreat cabin. The kitchen is complete with all appliances, pots, pans, and most dishes you will need for 2, just bring your food and drink and you'll be ready to enjoy breakfast on the deck while watching deer and elk graze in the meadow.
  %p We recommend the cabin for couples and singles. This gives you the most restful experience.
  %p However, it is possible for 2 children to sleep in the living room on the sofas or the floor. You will need to bring sleeping bags for the sofas and floor as there are no linens provided for these spaces.  The full bath provides towels for 2 adults, bring additional towels for children. A tent on the lawn outside is also an added option for the kids.
  %p There is a 4 person maximum for this building.

  %div.subhead Improvements and Projects
  We are working on improving the paint on the outside of the building and the deck furniture for more comfort on those leisurely mornings of meadow watching. If you'd like to assist with either of these projects we'd love to hear from you!
