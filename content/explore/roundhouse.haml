%div.fac_description
  %p Yurt style camping for 4 people in a fully enclosed 18' diameter round cedar building.
  %p Kitchenette amenities include: small refrigerator, microwave, and coffee maker. The Roundhouse has lights, covered porch with a view, a picnic table, and BBQ.
  %p There is no water, bathrooms, or heat in the roundhouse. It really is a nice step up from a tent.
  %p The public restrooms are a short walk across the upper meadow.

  %div.subhead Reservations
  Because the building isn't heated it tends to be much busier during the summer months, so make sure to reserve early unless you're one of our brave winter campers!

  A place to camp when you have forgotten the tent poles. A spot for the snoring family members you donâ€™t want in the tent. A great first camping spot for families with small kids.

%div#tab_needs.tab-content
  We are working at adding a new roof to the roundhouse and possibly a small electric heater
